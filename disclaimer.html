        <h1>Legal Disclaimer</h1>
      

        <h2>1. General Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>The information contained on this website and the services provided by PrimeSecurityTech are for general information purposes only. While we strive to keep the information up to date and accurate, we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability, or availability of the website or services.</p>

        <h2>2. Security System Limitations</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 No Guarantee of Security</h3>
        <p>Security systems are designed to reduce the risk of burglary, fire, and other emergencies, but cannot guarantee complete protection. No security system can prevent all possible intrusions or eliminate all risk of loss or damage.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Environmental Factors</h3>
        <p>System performance may be affected by environmental conditions including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Power outages and electrical interference</li>
            <li>Internet and cellular service interruptions</li>
            <li>Extreme weather conditions</li>
            <li>Physical obstructions or damage to equipment</li>
            <li>Interference from other electronic devices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 False Alarms</h3>
        <p>Security systems may occasionally generate false alarms due to environmental factors, equipment malfunction, user error, or external interference. Customers are responsible for any fines or fees imposed by local authorities for excessive false alarms.</p>

        <h2>3. Monitoring Service Limitations</h2>
        
        <h3>3.1 Communication Dependency</h3>
        <p>Monitoring services depend on communication networks including telephone, internet, and cellular services that are outside our control. Signal transmission may be interrupted, delayed, or blocked by various factors.</p>

        <h3>3.2 Response Time</h3>
        <p>While we strive for rapid response to alarm signals, response times may vary depending on signal transmission speed, monitoring center workload, and emergency service availability. We cannot guarantee specific response times.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Emergency Service Coordination</h3>
        <p>We coordinate with local emergency services but cannot control their availability, response time, or actions. Emergency service response depends on factors beyond our control.</p>

        <h2>4. Installation and Technical Disclaimers</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Property Conditions</h3>
        <p>Installation quotations are based on standard conditions. Additional work may be required for non-standard installations, older buildings, or unexpected site conditions. Customer will be notified of additional costs before proceeding.</p>

        <h3>4.2 Existing Systems</h3>
        <p>Integration with existing security or home automation systems may not always be possible due to compatibility limitations. We will make reasonable efforts to integrate systems where technically feasible.</p>

        <h3>4.3 Technology Evolution</h3>
        <p>Security technology evolves rapidly. Installed systems may become outdated over time, and manufacturer support for older equipment may be discontinued. We recommend regular system reviews and updates.</p>

        <h2>5. Legal and Regulatory Compliance</h2>
        
        <h3>5.1 Customer Responsibility</h3>
        <p>Customers are responsible for ensuring their security systems comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and homeowners' association requirements. This includes proper notification of surveillance recording and compliance with privacy laws.</p>

        <h3>5.2 Permits and Approvals</h3>
        <p>Customers are responsible for obtaining any required permits, approvals, or notifications before installation. We will provide guidance but cannot guarantee approval from authorities or associations.</p>

        <h3>5.3 Privacy Laws</h3>
        <p>Video surveillance systems must comply with federal, state, and local privacy laws. Customers must post appropriate notices and ensure recording practices comply with applicable regulations.</p>

        <h2>6. Data and Privacy Disclaimers</h2>
        
        <h3>6.1 Data Security</h3>
        <p>While we implement industry-standard security measures, no system is completely immune to unauthorized access. We cannot guarantee absolute security of stored data or transmitted information.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>Our services may integrate with third-party platforms and services over which we have no control. We are not responsible for the security, privacy practices, or availability of third-party services.</p>

        <h2>7. Website and Information Disclaimers</h2>

        <h3>9.2 Software and Firmware</h3>
        <p>System software and firmware are developed by third parties and may contain bugs or vulnerabilities. Updates and patches are provided by manufacturers and may change system functionality.</p>

        <h2>10. Force Majeure</h2>
        <p>We are not liable for any failure or delay in performance under any agreement due to circumstances beyond our reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God, natural disasters, government actions, labor strikes, or material shortages.</p>
